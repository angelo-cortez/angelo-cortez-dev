      Hey! I&apos;m Angelo Cortez, a software developer and AirBnB Superhost based in the SF Bay Area!
      <br />
      <br />
      I started off my career as a solutions engineer at Epic, where I did development on their risk of sepsis risk and deterioration index models for hospitals. Asynchronously, I started my masters in CS @ UW Madison, where I worked under Professor Dane Morgan working on materials machine learning research.
      <br />
      <br />
      After three years at Epic, I joined 8x8 as a software engineer where I&apos;ve built UCaaS and CCaaS automations for SMBs and enterprises, creating integrations that streamline operations and drive efficiency for customers&apos; contact centers. I also collaborate with customers on custom routing configurations to enhance call flow, automate interactions, and improve customer experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      My current interests are applications of AI in tax, finance, and real estate.
